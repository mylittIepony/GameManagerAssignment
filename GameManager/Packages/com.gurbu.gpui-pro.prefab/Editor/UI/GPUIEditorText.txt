disableDefaultRenderersWarning|Disable Default Renderers||This action will disable all Mesh Renderers and LOD Groups in this prefab.\n\nDisabling these components will speed up initialization in the Prefab Manager, as GPUI won’t need to iterate through prefab instances to disable them at runtime. It is recommended to apply this after completing scene design and to avoid manually toggling renderer components on the prefab or its instances.\n\nAre you sure you want to disable Default Renderers?|
